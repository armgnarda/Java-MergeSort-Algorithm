# Java-MergeSort-Algorithm
About This repository contains an implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm in Java. Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and is commonly used in various applications. The code demonstrates how to implement the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

Merge Sort has a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛log𝑛) and a space complexity of O(n). This means that given an array of size n, Merge Sort will perform approximately 𝑛log𝑛
comparisons on average to sort the array. This algorithm is generally considered fast and efficient, performing well with large-scale data.
